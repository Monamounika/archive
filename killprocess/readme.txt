kill a process(s), through a pid, interactively using Bash, kill

if there are multiple PID's with that process name, a prompt will ask for permission to kill it, though, and rather a stupid method, which will be changed, denying permission will result in an infinite loop, until permision is granted. again, this will be change, and soon. 

syntax:
 ./kill_process.sh $PROGRAM
