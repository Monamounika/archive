# numboard-shell
a small python based command shell that makes use of the numpad.

the character code list is in character_table.txt
0 - clears the buffer
1 - executes what is in the buffer
-0 - exits the numboard shell

the shell will always provide a preview so that no unnecesary executions of commands are performed without you consent, which means you have to execute the command with character code 1.

this shell's primary purpose is to allow console operation without a fullsize keyboard, but instead to use the number keypad provided with your keyboard, thus allowing for single handed operation. if something breaks, it is not my fault. Please let me know if there are any bugs, and I will sort them out. 

Sincerely,


LinuxNoGui

p.s. 
 if you have not read the source, please note that you will need python 3.4 to use this shell
