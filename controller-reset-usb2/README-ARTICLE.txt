The Article provided is not my mine, but rather is included to provide proof of inspiration, or direction as some might put it,
for the script included in this repository. Eventually, I will make this script contain a USB3.0 component as well. Since, this
is a first time messing with the controllers like this, I might find other options that could be added to this down the line,
but for now, this is what is available, and remember, the article is not mine, but the credit should go to the author of the article
at http://www.zedt.eu/tech/linux/restarting-usb-subsystem-centos/.
